To that end, we provide a list of the features required to operate and use edge computing resources, and investigate how an existing IaaS manager (i.e., OpenStack) satisfies these requirements. Finally, we identify from this study two approaches to design an edge infrastructure manager that fulfils our requirements, and discuss their pros and cons.","tags":null,"title":"Edge Computing Resource Management System: a Critical Building Block!

For scalability, reliability and performance, modular applications are distributed on infrastructures that support utility computing (e.g., Cloud, Fog). In order to simply operate such infrastructures, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) manager is required. OpenStack is the de-facto open-source solution to address the IaaS level of the Cloud paradigm. However, OpenStack is itself a large modular application composed of more than 150 modules that make it hard to deploy manually. To fully understand how IaaSes are deployed today, we propose in this paper an overall model of the application deployment process which describes each step with their interactions. This model then serves as the basis to analyse five different deployment tools used to deploy OpenStack in production: Kolla, Enos, Juju, Kubernetes, and TripleO. Finally, a comparison is provided and the results are discussed to extend this analysis.","tags":null,"title":"Production Deployment Tools for IaaSes: an Overall Model and Survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronan-Alexandre Cherrueau","Dimitri Pertin","Anthony Simonet","Adrien Lebre","Matthieu Simonin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1494720000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1494720000,"objectID":"6b109b2d139fb3f077a77e96355fe625","permalink":"https://dpertin.github.io/publication/ccgrid2017cherrueau/","publishdate":"2017-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ccgrid2017cherrueau/","section":"publication","summary":"By massively adopting OpenStack for operating small to large private and public clouds, the industry has made it one of the largest running software project, overgrowing the Linux kernel. However, with success comes increased complexity; facing technical and scientific challenges, developers are in great difficulty when testing the impact of individual changes on the performance of such a large codebase, which will likely slow down the evolution of OpenStack. Thus, we claim it is now time for the scientific community to join the effort and get involved in the development of OpenStack, like it has been once done for Linux. In this spirit, we developed Enos, an integrated framework that relies on container technologies for deploying and evaluating OpenStack on any testbed. Enos allows researchers to easily express different configurations, enabling fine-grained investigations of OpenStack services. Enos collects performance metrics at runtime and stores them for post-mortem analysis and sharing. The relevance of the Enos approach to reproducible research is illustrated by evaluating different OpenStack scenarios on the Grid'5000 testbed.","tags":null,"title":"Toward a Holistic Framework for Conducting Scientific Evaluations of OpenStack","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dimitri Pertin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461283200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461283200,"objectID":"8f64d50ed2d00d2044f7e10d62433ab3","permalink":"https://dpertin.github.io/publication/phd2016pertin/","publishdate":"2016-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phd2016pertin/","section":"publication","summary":"Erasure codes can generate data redundancy in distributed storage systems. This redundancy can be used to recover missing data in case of a failure. Codes have the benefit of reducing the generated amount of redundancy drastically,compared to plain data replication. However, this reduction is combined with a significant computational complexity, which penalizes encoding and decoding performances, and limits the use of coding to cold data. In this thesis, we focus on the use of the Mojette transform as an effective erasure code, adapted to hot data. The resulting code requires more redundancy than classical codes though. The first contribution of this research work deals with the design of a systematic version of the Mojette erasure code. This version provides better performances while reducing the required amount of redundancy. The second contribution covers the integration of this solution in the distributed file system RozoFS. This integration enables the system to provide a continuous service despite failures, while being able to manage hot data with half the volume of data compared to replication-based systems. A third research focus addresses the design of a distributed method to compute extra Mojette codeword symbols. This method contributes to restore a redundancy threshold in the storage system.","tags":null,"title":"Mojette Erasure Code for Distributed Storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dimitri Pertin","Alexandre Van Kempen","Benoît Parrein","Nicolas Normand"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1434067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1434067200,"objectID":"c69c6115d1ee981e96429a97f848388f","permalink":"https://dpertin.github.io/publication/sifwict2015pertin/","publishdate":"2015-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sifwict2015pertin/","section":"publication","summary":"Coding techniques for RAID-6 storage systems, providing a double fault-tolerance, are varied. They all come with their respective benefits and limitations. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of five prominent erasure codes. We show that the general-purpose Reed-Solomon codes, either based on Vandermonde or Cauchy matrices, are outperformed by Array codes (i.e. EVENODD, RDP) which are specifically designed for RAID-6 storage systems. However geometrical codes such as the Mojette erasure code show even better performances at the cost of a slight extra storage overhead. We outline the differences between these codes in terms of encoding, updating and decoding complexity.

While this technique relies on the geometric properties of ghosts, which are elements of the 2D image that sum to zero following some projection directions, we show an equivalent method using 1D convolutions, thus avoiding the explicit image reconstruction.

But in such large system, failures are frequent and expected. Data replication is the common technique to provide fault-tolerance but suffers from its important storage consumption. Erasure coding is an alternative that offers the same data protection but reduces significantly the storage consumption. As it entails additional workload, current storage providers limit its use for longterm storage. We present the Mojette Transform (MT), an erasure code whose computations rely on fast XOR operations. The MT is part of RozoFS, a distributed file system that provides a global namespace relying on a cluster of storage nodes. This work is part of our ongoing effort to prove that erasure coding is not necessarily a bottleneck for intense I/O applications. In order to validate our approach, we consider a case study involving a storage cluster of RozoFS that supports video editing as an I/O intensive application.","tags":null,"title":"A Distributed File System Based on Erasure Coding for I/O-Intensive Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"8e93c7790bd4fc4b8cb4665463302765","permalink":"https://dpertin.github.io/project/fec4cloud/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fec4cloud/","section":"project","summary":"FEC4Cloud is an ANR project that aims at promoting erasure codes in fault-tolerant Cloud storage architectures, by investigating algebraic soutions (e.g. Reed-Solomon codes) and codes based on discrete geometry (e.g. Mojette codes).","tags":["erasure_code"],"title":"FEC4Cloud: Forward Error Correcting codes for Cloud storage architectures","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dimitri Pertin","Giulio D'Ippolito","Nicolas Normand","Benoît Parrein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1341360000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1341360000,"objectID":"693d74435b8c40ca7074f891a7e0878e","permalink":"https://dpertin.github.io/publication/isivc2012pertin/","publishdate":"2012-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/isivc2012pertin/","section":"publication","summary":"Fault-tolerance has been widely studied these years in order to fit new kinds of applications running on unreliable systems such as the Internet.
